## Technologies

SequentialSounds was built using:

- `JavaScript` for foundational code
- `Tone.js` for interfacing with Web Audio
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.


## Architecture

`structure.js` primarily handles the construction of the sequencer prior to user interaction.
  - Each note is built by constructing individual (div's) attributed with various pre-set values.
  - Each row is built utilizing a set of the notes, as well as an identifying sound for playback.
  - Each new Sequencer instance is generated by the creation of 8 rows.

`sequencer.js` functions analyze the DOM to determine Tone.js sequence functions and orchestrate the presence of CSS selectors.
  - A new Tone.Sequence is constructed by passing in a position, function and set of "events"
  - The evenly-spaced events "trigger" the release of different note values according to their position and data-selected Boolean
  - The note value is determined based on an array of musical note values that correspond to the scale values available for selection.
